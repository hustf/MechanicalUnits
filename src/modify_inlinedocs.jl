    preferunits(u0::Units, u::Units...)
This function specifies the default fallback units for promotion.
Units provided to this function must have a pure dimension of power 1, like Length or Time
but not Length/Time or Length^2. The function will complain if this is not the case. Additionally,
the function will complain if you provide two units with the same dimension, as a
courtesy to the user. Finally, you cannot use affine units such as Â°C with this function.

Once [`Unitful.upreferred`](@ref) has been called or quantities have been promoted,
this function will appear to have no effect.

Usage example: `preferunits(u"m,s,A,K,cd,kg,mol"...)`
