### Using units helps you
We're using Julia to solve difficult problems, but what about the easy ones?

Including units gives

* Fewer mistakes
* More pattern recognition
* Quicker problem solving
* An alternative approach to understanding calculations


## Usage
```julia
using MechanicalUnits
E=206GPa
A = 1mm*1mm
E*A/10100mmm
20.40N/mm
ans*100kg*g
2000mm
```

## Goals
This aims to make Julia the preferred calculator for quick side calculations. 
We accept being less general where it's massively useful. 

 Which means:
* Quantities use four significant digits with engineering formatting and unit prefixing common 
to structural and mechanical engineering.
* REPL output can be copied to make input: We print '2.32m/s' instead of '2.32 m s^-1"
* Vector output moves the units outside where possible: [1, 2]m
* We use Unicode symbols which can be shown in the Windows REPL and a nice font. ùêì, ùêã and ùêå are replaced.
* We want to support unitful complex numbers as it helps in equation solving. It may mean switching dependencies.

## FAQ

- ***Is this for real?***

Yes. Unlike complex numbers. This is not so far for complex numbers.

*What does this cost?*

It costs nothing if your time is free.
